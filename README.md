# solar-turning
A short program so that the EV3 turns with the sun.

## This code turns a specific ev3python setup so that it turns with the sun. When paired with a solar panel, it can maximize the amount of energy created from it.

### The basic code revolves around the Parts.check() function, which checks if the left color sensor and right color sensor have a large difference, or just a small one.

### So far, we have fixed these issues with the program

- [x] Turns
- [x] Implemented design
- [ ] Turns with the sun
- [ ] Has been tested with the sun
